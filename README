Website Goals

Bg – #f8ecdc

Factors:
Wildfires require the alignment of a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, and the lack of moisture in fuels, such as trees, shrubs, grasses, and forest debris. All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and climate change. 


Wildfire alert website
Problem to solve: 
Features:
Determines the frequency at which wildfires have occurred at the user’s location
Displays the likelihood of a wildfire due to dry weather
??
Ong thats what i was thinking

And grey 
We should use this black: #2d2d2a
I said we should have a slight orange tint on parts of the website because orange is kinda like fire



Like you see how they have a little bit of green
We could do that with orange
 Oh bet

Design:
Rounded corners for images, text boxes,
Fonts
Title: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+Glitch+Pop?preview.text=WILD%20FIRES&query=w (possibly? Looks like fire)
Regular text: Any easy to read font

Background color: #f5ebdc

Current Concept:

Main page – 
topic/name of our website
Blurb about what’s it about => overlaying a background image
7 clear button for each continent – links to another page

Each page will detail the geography of the continent
key of different colors
Details probability of wild fire occuring based on the country/state
(color fill into border of country/state)

Rinse and Repeat


For each continent we can do something like this, where we use dots to represent the area
Then we change each dot based on their history with wildfires
